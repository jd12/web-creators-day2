# Day 2 Challenge

This challenge asks you to create the home and menu pages for a small coffee shop.<br>

You will also create the [music](music.txt) and [jobs](jobs.txt) pages using the text files provided in the repository for the content.

I have included a [template html](template.html) file for you to use for all pages in the site. You must use this file as the basis for all other site pages.

The [music](music.png) and [jobs](jobs.png) pages must look like the image files included in the repository.

The music page content contains links to external web sites. Format these as [absolute hyperlinks](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_target) that open in a new browser window.

When you are done, you will have four html files:

index.html<br>
menu.html<br>
jobs.html<br>
music.html<br>

Name your project according to this scheme:

FirstInitialLastName_Day2

for example:
