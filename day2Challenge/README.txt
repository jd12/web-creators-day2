Day 2 Challenge

This challenge asks you to create the home and menu pages for a small coffee shop
.
You will also create the music and jobs pages using the text files provided in the repository for the content.

I have included a template html file for you to use for all pages in the site. You must use this file as the basis for all other site pages.

The music and jobs pages must look like the image files included in the repository.

The music page content contains links to external web sites. Format these as [absolute hyperlinks](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_target) that open in a new browser window.

When you are done, you will have four html files:

index.html
menu.html
jobs.html
music.html

Name the zip file:  firstnameFirstLetterofLastname_hwk2.zip, i.e.

 "GordonA_hwk2.zip"
