cis 151 Homework

This homework is based on the JavaJam Coffee House Case Study from the text page 61. This activity asks you to create the home and menu pages.
You will also create the music and jobs pages using the text files provided with this assignment for the content.

I have included a template html file for you to use for all pages in the site. You must use this file as the basis for all other site pages.

The music and jobs pages must look like the image files included with this assignment.

The music page content contains links to external web sites. Format these as absolute hyperlinks that open in a new browser window.

When you are done, you will have four html files:

index.html
menu.html
jobs.html
music.html

Place them in an archive file ( a .zip file for example) and upload that file to this assignment.


Name the zip file:  firstnameFirstLetterofLastname_hwk2.zip, i.e.

 "GordonA_hwk2.zip"

Remember there are several types of archive or compression applications. 
Some common file extensions are: .rar, .zip, .gz. 
All are acceptable. Windows and Mac come with such an application.
