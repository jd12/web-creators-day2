# Day 2 Challenge Part I 

### Create home page

First thing you're going to do is create a new Thimble project and replace the starter code with the code in [template.html](template.html)

1. Change the title in between the head tags to `JavaJam Coffee House`
2. Code the header element with the text, "JavaJam Coffee House" contained within a `<h1>` and `</h1>`
3. Place the following text within a nav element with bold text (use the `<b>` element):<br>
Home Menu Music Jobs<br><br>
Code anchor tags so that "Home" links to index.html, "Menu" links to menu.html, "Music" links to music.html, and "Jobs" links to jobs.html. Add extra blank spaces with the `&nbsp;` special character as needed.
4. Code the main content within the div element. 
- Configure the following content in an unordered list:<br>
Specialty Coffee and Tea<br>
Bagels, Muffins, and Organic Snacks<br>
Music and Poetry Readings<br>
Open Mic Night Every Friday Night<br>

- Code the following address and phone number contact information within a div element. Use `<br>` tags to help you configure this area and add extra space between the phone number and the footer area. <br><br>

54321 Route 42<br>
Ellison Bay, WI 54210<br>
1-888-555-5555<br>

5. Configure the following copyright and e-mail link information within the footer element. Format it with small text size (use the `<small>` tag) and italics font style (use the `<i>` tag). <br><br>

### Menu Page
Create the menu page shown in [menu.png](menu.png). A technique that improves productivity is to create new pages based on existing pages so that you can benefit from your previous work. Your new Menu page will use the index.html page as a starting point. <br>

Create a new html file in your Thimble project and rename it menu.html. Replace the starter code with the code from your index.html file 

1. Modify the page title. Change the text contained between the `<title>` and `</title>` tags to the following:

JavaJam Coffee House Menu

2. Delete the Home page content unordered list and contact information. 

3. Use a description list to add the menu content to the page. Start off by adding your `<dl>` and `</dl>` tags which will contain your description list. Use the `<dt>` tag to contain each menu item name. Configure the menu item name to have strong importance and display in bold font weight with the `<strong>` tag. Use the `<dd>` tag to contain the menu item description.
